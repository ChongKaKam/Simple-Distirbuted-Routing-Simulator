# Simple-Distirbuted-Routing-Simulator
SDRS(Simple Distributed Routing Simulator) is a simple platform in which allow to test some distributed routing algorithms.

### 1 Motivation

Recently, I am researching the routing algorithm. Once I read a new paper, and want to try the core idea of the algorithm, I have to be face with the complicated "Simulator" like `MiniNet` or `NS-3`. It is hard to deploy the algorithm since the large and complicated architecture of these apps. Therefore, I want to try to develop a simple application to help me deploy algorithms easily. It is `SDRS`.

### 2 Basic Introduction

So far, I divided the app into two parts, one is the **core** which is shown in `core.h`  and `core.cc` and the other part is **MyRouter** which is shown in `myrouter.cc` and `myrouter.h`. I manage the program in `makefile`. The commands of `makefile` are shown later.

The main architecture can be shown as below

#### 2.1 Core

The **Core** contains `Event`, `Link`, `RouterBase` and `Simulator`. 

##### Event Class

The `Event` is the ADT of the simulation events. We use the priority queue to manage simulation events. These events are sorted in time increasing order. The content of an event includes time, source_id, destination_id and a pointer which points to the data. 

```c++
class Event
{
    public:
        Event();
        Event(uint32_t EventTime, int source, int destination, void *pData);
        bool operator<(const Event &a) const;
        bool operator>(const Event &a) const;
        bool operator==(const Event &a) const;
        Event& operator=(const Event &a);
    public:
        uint32_t time;
        int Src;
        int Dst;
        void* ptrToData;
};
```

##### Link Class

The `Link` is the ADT of the connectivity of nodes (routers). This class is mainly responsible for the link information in DSRS. It has two values: `cost` and `pdst`. The `cost` shows the cost of this link and the `pdst` is the pointer which points to the `RouterBase`.

```c++
class Link
{
    public:
        Link(CostType Cost, ptrToRouterBase pDst);
    public:
        CostType cost;
        ptrToRouterBase pdst;
};
```

##### RouterBase Class

The `RouterBase` is the base class of the router, it has some virtual function which you should complete before you start simulating. You can implement your algorithm in the derived class of `RouterBase`. There are three function you should implement: `AddLink()`ï¼Œ`init()` and `update()`. 

+ The `AddLink()` will be called when you set up the links between nodes in `Simulator`. However, it is fine to call this function manually to add links to your network.
+ The `init()` is responsible for initialization of a router. The initialization includes setting the informations and enqueue events to the `EventQueue`. It will be called at the beginning of the simulation. When the `Simulator` calls its member function `Simulator::Init()` , the function will traversal all routers and call their function `RouterBase::init()`. 
+ The `update()` is where you can implement your algorithm. Every time the `Simulator` dequeue an event and take relative actions will call the relative routers' `RouterBase::update()` functions to process this event.

##### Simulator Class

All components are assembled in this class: `Event` and `EventQueue` , `RouterBase`, Adjacent Matrix of its topology and tims. Therefore, the `Simulator` can be considered as the **Brain** which schedules all events and manages all components.

There are some constructer in the `Simulator`:

```c++
// empty
Simulator(ptrToRouterBaseVector *ptr);
// recommand the way below:
// initialized by the adjacent matrix
Simulator(ptrToRouterBaseVector *ptr, int nodeNum, CostType **adjacentMatrix);
```

As you can see, the simulator need a `ptrToRouterBaseVector` . It is defined as:

```c++
typedef vector<ptrToRouterBase> ptrToRouterBaseVector;
```

This vector contains the pointer which points to the `RouterBase` like class. So it is fine to add pointers which point to your class which is inherited from the `RouterBase` class. 



In this README, I just show some key informations and functions that are important for you to use this program. More details are shown in the source code. If you have some questions, you can try to read codes for help or hand up issues. 

#### 2.2 MyRouter

The codes are shown in  `myrouter.cc` and `myrouter.h`. This part is where you can inherit `RouterBase` class and realize your ideas.

When you inherit a new class,
